A sampling program:
	1) sample.c: c program 
		Input: file
		Output: stdout
	2) sample.pl: perl script
		Input: stdin
		Output: stdout

Function:
	Output the random K results from one series without the prior of the length N

So This can be used as a long time sampling through Internet Communication

Complexity:
	Space:
		O(k)
	Time:
		O(N)

Algorithm:
	Reservoir Sampling
